# This is a Java game I made inspired by minesweeper.  The white dot is the player, who must traverse a 2-D grid one space at a time.  
# The goal is to find the treasure that is hidden in one random space on the grid.  The fewer moves you make, the more points you score.
# This project includes a full tutorial, 3 difficulty settings, and a score system.
